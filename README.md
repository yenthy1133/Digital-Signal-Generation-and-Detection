# Digital-Signal-Generation-and-Detection
Our project is based on chapter 7: Digital-Signal-Generation-and-Detection of "Sen M. Kuo | Bob H. Lee | Wenshun Tian, “Real-Time Digital Signal Processing: Fundamentals, Implementations and Applications”, 3rd edition.

We decided to create a App Designer in MATLAB as a visual guide for everyone to easily understand.

In order to run the app, you have to make sure that you download all the .mlapp file, .m files and other files into one same folder.
